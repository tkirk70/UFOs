OSU Module 11 - Java Script :milky_way:

- Overview of Project: The purpose of the project was to use JavaScript to display data on a webpage in a way that could be filtered for multiple criteria.
- Results: All of the data can be seen in the table upon first landing or refreshing the page.  Filterable categories include: city, state, country, and shpae of object.

Unfiltered Table:

 ![]("/static/images/no_filter.PNG")

Table filtered by state:

 ![]("/static/images/search_by_state.PNG")


- Summary: One drawback from the project is the lack of data from international locations (other than Canada).  More extensive data would greatly enhance the project and analysis.  Two recommendations are: adding photographs or other recordings from eyewitnesses.  Adding a commited database (perhaps MongoDB) to store files other than simple arrays.

Another issues is that the data for benton, ar was keyed into the .js file to have 'country' before 'state'.  It is still filterable but the columns don't align with the others.  See image #2.
